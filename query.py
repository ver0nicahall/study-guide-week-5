# Part 2: Discussion Questions


# 1. What is the datatype of the returned value of
# ``Brand.query.filter_by(name='Ford')``?



# 2. In your own words, what is an association table, and what type of
# relationship (many to one, many to many, one to one, etc.) does an
# association table manage?




# -------------------------------------------------------------------
# Part 3: SQLAlchemy Queries


# Get the brand with the brand_id of ``ram``.
q1 = Brand.query.filter_by(brand_id='ram').one()

# Get all models with the name ``Corvette`` and the brand_id ``che``.
q2 = Model.query.filter(Model.name == 'Corvette', Model.brand_id == 'che').all()

# Get all models that are older than 1960.
q3 = Model.query.filter(Model.year < 1960).all()

# Get all brands that were founded after 1920.
q4 = Brand.query.filter(Brand.founded > 1920).all()

# Get all models with names that begin with ``Cor``.
q5 = Model.query.filter(Model.name.like('Cor%')).all()

# Get all brands that were founded in 1903 and that are not yet discontinued.
q6 = Brand.query.filter(Brand.founded == 1903, Brand.discontinued == None).all()

# Get all brands that are either 1) discontinued (at any time) or 2) founded
# before 1950.
q7 = Brand.query.filter((Brand.discontinued == None) | (Brand.founded < 1950)).all()

# Get all models whose brand_id is not ``for``.
q8 = Model.query.filter(Model.brand_id != 'for').all()
